    5:15 to 6:00 -> Parameterization
    6:00 to 6:30 -> Passing multiple data

 Cucumber:
 Gherkin Keywords:
 ================
  1. Feature: Login Functionality of Leaftaps Application   
       -> describes the functionality of an application
  2. Scenario: Login with Positive Credentials
      -> describes the testcase   
      a. Given Launch the browser
         And Load the url
         And Enter the username
         And Enter the password
          -> represent the precondition      
      b. When Click on the Login Button
          -> represents the test condition
      c. Then HomePage should be displayed
          -> represents the expected result(for positive scenario)
      d. But Error message should be displayed
          -> represents the expected result(for negative scenario) 
  3.  Scenario Outline: Create Lead for multiple data
        -> Pass different sets of data for a Scenario  
  4. Examples:
        -> carry values to Scenario Outline

 Steps to create layers of Cucucmber:
  1. Under src/test/java create 3 packages
       - features
           - Create feature file
                 Right click -> features package-> New -> Other -> expand General folder\
                 -> double click File-> Give file name-> Login and extension is feature
                 -> Click finish
       - steps
           - Create Step Defintion class inside steps package
           - Create methods for each step of the feature file inside StepDefintion
           - Put the Selenium codes for implementation inside each methods
           - On the top of each methods integrate the faeture file and StepDefintion
             ex: @Given("Launch the browser")
	public void launchBrowser() {
		driver = new ChromeDriver();	
	}
       - runner
           - Inside runner package create a class called CucumberRunner
           - On the top of the runner class use @CucumberOptions and use some of the attributes
              features -> mention the path of the feature file
              glue     -> mention the package name of StepDefinition
              monochrome-> remove the unreadable/junk characters from the console
              publish   -> to get the cucumber report in the console
           - Finally for execution the runner class should extend AbstractTestNGCucumberTests   


Paramterization:
  - Surround different data in multiple scenario with ''
  - In StepDefinition class on top of the corresponding method replace the data
    with {string}
  - To pass input to the method pass argument
  - Finally, replace the hardcoded data with the argument

  Exception:
   - UndefineStepException
   - DuplicateStepDefintionException
