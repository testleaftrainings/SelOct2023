Todays Agenda:
   2:30 - 3:00 -> TestNG Introduction
   3:00 - 4:00 -> Sequential Execution
   4:00 - 4:30 -> Breakout
   4:30 - 5:15 -> Parallel Execution
   5:15 - 5:30 -> Breakout
   5:30 - 6:30 -> Annotations

Limitation:
1. Running the multiple testcases individually
Expectation:
 Execute multiple testcases in a single click either sequentially / parallel-> Saves time

2. Passing multiple data
Expectation:
  I could pass mutiple data to a testcase using TestNG

3. Basic REport:
    pass, fail. skip

testng.xml structure:
=====================
<suite>
 <test>
  <classes>
    <class name=""/>
  </classes>
 </test>
</suite>    

Steps to do Sequential Execution:
==================================
1. Select the required testcases to be executed
2. Right Click -> Click TestNG at the bottom -> Click Convert to TestNG
3. A testng.xml wizard will appear
4. Check whether the selected testcases appear in the preview
5. Click Finish-> A testng.xml file will appear inside your project
6. Double click on the testng.xml file to open
Note: Click Source tab at the bottom to view the testng.xml file structure
7. To get the failure logs in the console add verbose attribute and specify the range
8. After execution, to get the report
    - Refresh your project
    - test-output folder will appear inside the project
    - Inside test-ouput folder-> right click-> index.html -> Show In -> System Editor to view the report
    - To view the emailable report double click -> emailable-report.html

Steps to do Parallel Execution:
==================================
1. Select the required testcases to be executed
2. Right Click -> Click TestNG at the bottom -> Click Convert to TestNG
3. A testng.xml wizard will appear
4. Select the parallel mode and mention the thread-count to control the number of instances
4. Check whether the selected testcases appear in the preview
5. Click Finish-> A testng.xml file will appear inside your project
6. Double click on the testng.xml file to open
Note: Click Source tab at the bottom to view the testng.xml file structure
7. To get the failure logs in the console add verbose attribute and specify the range
8. After execution, to get the report
    - Refresh your project
    - test-output folder will appear inside the project
    - Inside test-ouput folder-> right click-> index.html -> Show In -> System Editor to view the report
    - To view the emailable report double click -> emailable-report.html

Annotation Hierarchy:
======================

    @BeforeSuite          -> executes once before any test methods in the Suite
       
       @BeforeTest        -> executes once before any test methods in the test tag
      
         @BeforeClass     -> executes once before any test methods in the class

           @BeforeMethod  -> executes before each test method

             @Test        -> test method

           @AfterMethod   -> executes after each test method

         @AfterClass      -> executes once after any test methods in the class

      @AfterTest          -> executes once after any test methods in the test tag
    
   @AfterSuite            -> executes once after any test methods in the Suite
